AGS-component-http-request
==========================

> AGS components are a set of AutoIt libraries, that you can use in your AutoIt project built with the [AGS framework](https://v20100v.github.io/autoit-gui-skeleton/). AGS-component-http-request is a library used to send HTTP request in POST or GET method in an AutoIt project build with AGS framework.

## Install

We assume that you have already install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/), for example with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/). We recommend you to install it with Yarn. To do this, just type in the root folder of your project where the `package.json` is saved :

```
Î»  yarn add @autoit-gui-skeleton/ags-component-http-request --modules-folder web/vendor
```

This package is installed into the `./vendor` directory. To use it in your AutoIt program, you need to include this library with this instruction:

```autoit
#include 'vendor/@autoit-gui-skeleton/ags-component-http-request/ags-component-http-request.au3'
```



<br/>

## AGS's vendor directory

By default Yarn and npm installs packages into the `./node_modules` directory. With an AGS project we want to install this kind of dependency package into the `./vendor/` directory, in order to avoid any confusion with a Node.js project. To do this we add the option `--modules-folder vendor`. 

You can omit this option normaly with an AGS project. Indeed, you are supposed to have the file `./.yarnrc` in the root folder of your AGS project, in the same place of your `pacakge.json` file. Yarn automatically looks into the `./.yarnrc` file for additional configuration options.

```
#./.yarnrc 
--modules-folder vendor
```

With this file, you can run `yarn add @autoit-gui-skeleton/ags-wrapper-json` to install it directly into the appropriate `./vendor` directory.
